          <h1>Dart’s Core Tenets</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            Dart has been used to ship many high-quality, mission-critical applications on the web, iOS, and Android at 
            Google and elsewhere. It is a great fit for mobile and web development because it is:
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-7 col-lg-8">
        <div class="content">
          <h2 class="core-goals__first">Productive</h2>
          <p>Syntax must be clear and concise, tooling simple, and dev cycles near-instant and on-device.</p>
          <p>Dart increases developer velocity because it has a clear, succinct syntax and is able to run on a 
            VM with a JIT compiler. The latter allows for <a href='https://flutter.io/hot-reload/'>stateful hot reload</a> 
            during mobile development, resulting in super fast dev cycles, where you can edit code, compile and replace 
            in the running app on the device.</p>
          <h2>Fast</h2>
          <p>Runtime performance and startup must be great and predictable even on small mobile devices.</p>
          <p>With its ability to efficiently compile to native code ahead of time, Dart provides predictable, 
            high performance and fast startup on mobile devices.</p>
          <h2>Portable</h2>
          <p>Client developers have to think about three platforms today: iOS, Android, and Web. The language needs to work 
            well on all of them.</p>
          <p>Dart supports compilation to native code (ARM, x86, etc.) for fast mobile performance as well as transpilation 
            to efficient JavaScript for the web.</p>
          <h2>Approachable</h2>
          <p>The language can’t stray too far from the familiar if it wishes to be relevant for millions of developers.</p>
          <p>Dart is approachable to many existing developers, thanks to its unsurprising object-oriented aspects and syntax 
            that — according to our users — allows any C++, C#, Objective-C, or Java developer to be productive in a matter 
            of days.</p>
          <h2>Reactive</h2>
          <p>A reactive style of programming should be supported by the language.</p>
          <p>Dart works well for reactive programming with its battle-hardened core libraries, including streams and futures; 
            it also has great support for managing short-lived objects through its fast generational garbage collector.</p>
